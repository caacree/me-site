title: Mapping with d3 and React
---
I've been messing around with React in recent months, and really love the improvement over spaghetti JQuery DOM Manipulation. This past week I started working on integrating d3 into React. 

I've always been interested in the South China Sea, and making a basic map / information about the dispute there seemed like a good project to try. For the anxious, the final project can be seen [here](http://caacree.github.io/South-China-Sea) and the code is [here](http://github.com/caacree/South-China-Sea)
 
Throughout the process, I relied heavily on [this post](https://medium.com/@sxywu/on-d3-react-and-a-little-bit-of-flux-88a226f328f3#.3x0r5vagi), who deserves some kind of award for most elaborate/detailed show project. Anyone interested in d3 and React should check out that post/repo first. 

The most important consideration when integrating the two is keeping a consistent DOM. Using d3's to insert or remove items from the DOM will break React. Stick to data, transitions and updating attributes in d3.
