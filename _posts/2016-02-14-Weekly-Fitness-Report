This week was overall pretty good for fitness, but highlighted a need for more consistency. 

### Workout Review

Monday was community running, 3 sets of long-ish runs with 2 sprint rounds in between. 

Tuesday was rest. 

Wednesday was the week-maker. I did two river laps in the morning, which, at over 10k, makes it the longest run I've ever done. Then I followed it up with running club, doing 400's. So overall over 15k for the day. 

After Wednesday I rested on my laurels too much though, and didn't run again until today, Sunday. I should have yesterday, but this weekend has been bitterly cold in Boston; the high today was around 8F. I made myself do 5k today on the treadmill just to get the week run count to 4. 

Gym-wise was a little better. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday were all lifting days. Squatting shows significant improvement, other gains are more modest. 

For the numbers, that makes 4 runs of about 25k (15 miles) for the week. 

### Diet Review

Pretty healthy week, until today. No junk food, soda, etc, plus very healthy meals. Today I fell off a bit with some Reece's and ordering a large calzone for dinner, but if that's the worst I've got this week I'll count myself as doing alright. 

Weight is at 199. 

### Other stuff

I'm thinking weight-wise I'm willing to bulk until 210 or so, but would rather not go further. Partly just because I'd like to avoid looking too big, and there's definitely room for me to grow a lot of muscle without necessarily topping 200 even. Also at some point I start to lose some running ability; slimming down for the summer should improve my speeds as I get more into racing. 

Bought a Garmin FR235 this week, so I can start to use that to track HR and time my workouts. I don't expect any crazy revelations to come from this, but it would definitely be nice to see my pace as I do outdoor runs, give me a better idea of where I am and some guidance as I push for better times. 

Had a bit of the twinge in the right shin during the 10k run, but it quickly passed and never really flared up. It came back stronger, and faster, during my 5k treadmill run. This still makes me think it's got to be a form issue that is exacerbated on the treadmill, but I'm not too worried since it hasn't made me stop an outdoor run yet. 

Also, more definite plans regarding my timeline. I'll be doing the Hyannis half-marathon on February 28. That gives me two weeks to get to that level. After that, running club is doing a marathon run on the Boston marathon trail in early April, which I've decided will be my first marathon attempt. That gives me about 5 weeks to get from half-marathon to marathon distance, which seems achievable. For now, just focusing on the upcoming half. 

### The Coming Week

Looking to achieve more consistency. It should be warmer starting tomorrow, so I hopefully won't see the extreme cold be an issue this week. The main goal this week is to get used to some longer runs. There should be two runs of at least 10k this week. Ideally I'll get five runs in, but if I need to rest more to make the longer ones happen, I'm ok with it. 

Will aim for 5 lifting sessions again. I'm trying to see if I can get more squat sessions in, maybe every other day instead of every 3rd, just double them up with whatever other muscle group I'm doing. 

No specific goals diet-wise. I'm doing pretty well right now, no need to rock the boat.
