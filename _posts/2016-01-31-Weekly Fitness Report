This week was mostly about trying new things, and trying to find sustainable habits for the coming months. On that note, it was mostly a success!

### Workout Review

On Monday I went to try out the [Boston Community Running](http://www.communityrunning.org/index.html) club. They do 1-1.5 hour workouts on Mondays and Wednesdays. It's good to get some external motivation and new workout days, plus they use the MIT indoor track so it's a chance to get some more precisely timed work in. I plan to join. 

I participated in the short-distance team, which mostly focused on speedwork. Both Monday and Wednesday were all short interval runs of 800 or less. I decided to rest Tuesday since Wednesday would be another speed day. 

Wednesday was another good workout with the club, then rested again on Thursday. 

Friday I did a 5k treadmill run, came in at around 26:40. I'm really going to try and avoid treadmill runs in the future; besides throwing my sense of times off (I've got significantly different times on different treadmill models), I'm pretty sure I don't have good form when treadmill running. After around 3k on treadmill runs, I start to get some soreness near my right shin, it's happened a few times now. Never happens on real runs, so I suspect a form issue. Anyways, treadmill running is a real slog anyways, I'm not sure I have the dedication to do it consistently, so I'll be pushing for real runs as much as possibe. 

Saturday, inspired to avoid the treadmill, I finally got out to explore the closest outdoor trail; the Charles River Esplanade. I did a full lap, which seems to be about 3.5 miles, or a little over 5k. It's a nice enough trail, particularly on the South Side, and hits no stop lights or road crossings, so it's easy to get in a good rhythm. Best of all, it goes right by my office, so I can conveniently get in runs before work. 

Sunday I repeated the Charles River Trail loop, though at a slower pace. I did it immediately after a leg lifting workout, so my main goal was just to get in the miles, and didn't worry about pace. About the slowest jog I can do, but I never walked, so there's that. Interestingly, because of that, this was the first significant run where I felt no strain on my endurance. I definitely felt it since I just finished squatting, but it was all in the legs, no stress at all with breathing or heart rate. 

So 5 runs total this week, not bad. Call each 5k to put me at 25k (~15 miles) for the week. 

Lifting was less successful; I didn't lift at all until Thursday. Thursday, Friday, and Sunday were my only days in the gym this week. Partly that was a result of still being busy getting up to speed at work, so I couldn't easily get in a workout in the morning (though I could, and probably should, have just gone in earlier). But I did get some home workout stuff to supplement the gym, and hope to get better at that this week. 

### Diet Review

The goal for the week was no coffee and alcohol, and I accomplished that goal. Overall diet was mixed; I had soda on three days, and fast food twice, some candy, etc. Overall most meals were healthy, but definitely room for improvement. 

I'm rolling back on the no coffee bit. On Friday at least, I was lagging and went with a soda and some sugary snacks to give me a boost. An occasional cup of coffee is definitely better than that, but I wanted to stick with the weeks goals so I avoided it at the time. Going forward, no coffee is nice, but I'll accept up to two cups a week if I need the boost. The important thing is avoiding building a tolerance to me, since I like to have that in my back pocket for when I need it. 

### Other Notes

The running club is good for motivation and mixing up workouts, but is more about community than coaching. I would have liked some guidance on form, breathing, etc, but that doesn't seem to be the focus. I'm sure I can get some general tips, but I'll probably need to look else where for more detailed guidance. Something to consider down the line. 

### The Coming Week

Sticking with 5 days of running this week, but one of them should be a 10k. Sticking with just getting in the miles for now, not focusing too much on specific intervals/paces just yet. Tentative schedule:

Monday - Running Club
Tuesday - Rest
Wednesday - Running Club
Thursday - 5k
Friday - Rest
Saturday - 10k
Sunday - 5k

One of these runs, probably one of the weekend ones, should be trying a new trail. 

Diet-wise, the goal for this week is to cut out the low-end junk food. No candy and no soda. As mentioned above, I'll allow the occasional coffee for when I need a boost, which should help in avoiding the temptation to go for the sugar rush. Also, I'm not declaring jihad on all sugars; I'll still allow restaurant desserts or maybe a nice dark chocolate bar at some point. The point is to start to direct my "cheat" foods to worthwhile areas, and avoid the temptation to get something just because it's around and easy.
