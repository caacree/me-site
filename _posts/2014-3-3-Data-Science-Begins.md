title: Starting Data Science
---

So I've decided to take the leap into data science and machine learning. I've been brushing up on my linear algebra and fired up Andrew Ng's recommended Coursera introduction to machine learning as a start. 

I have experience in linear and logistic regressions from my Econometrics and Statistics classes, but have never played with them much in code. So this will be mostly new territory for me, especially once I go into other algorithms. 

I must say I'm finding the Coursera class to be a bit slow thus far. They've clearly chosen to assume little math background to open the field to more casual students, which is understandable, but even non-mathematical ideas are often expounded at a snail's pace. 

To be fair, this is a common problem from my experience in online courses. Too many experts assume teaching online means teaching to as many as possible, and make the tradeoff of more students for less rigor. I've seen the same thinking in Coursera, Khan Academy, and EduX courses. There's a strong need to courses that explain everything at length, and I'm glad they're filling it, but I'm still waiting for an educational platform that can handle students who don't need spoon-feeding. 

No study is complete without application, so I've signed up for Kaggle, where I'll be expliring their beginner's [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) before jumping into one of the more competitive datasets. I plan to post occasional updates here as I go. Stay tuned!
