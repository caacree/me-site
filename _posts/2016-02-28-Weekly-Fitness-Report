Missed last week's update, so we're in for a double today. I'll cover each week separately here. 

### Week of 2/21 Workout Review

A 5k river run on Monday morning, followed by a running club workout in the evening. 

Tuesday was rest. 

Wednesday featured a 10k run in the morning. 

Took Thursday and Friday off.

I went for a long run on Saturday, a little over 9 miles, covering a new section of the riverfront I can't get to as easily during the week. 

Sunday didn't have a run, but did about 5 hours of hiking, through the city and then in a nearby reserve. 

I'm forgetting the gym stats, but I think it was 3-4 times for the week, so average. 

For the numbers, that makes 4 runs of about 35k (21 miles) for the week. 

### Week of 2/28 Workout Review

This was a lax week, mostly by design in preparation for the half marathon race on Sunday. There were no gym workouts, which was not explicitly race related, just an omission. 

One run on Wednesday, a full half marathon (13.1 miles) of distance though. Came in at a hair under 1:50. Just doing it on the indoor track nearby. Very not fun having to count 200m laps for that long. Need at least an outdoor track that's longer and can utilize the GPS for future editions. 

Interestingly, I found that my cardio and legs both held up quite well throughout. In the last mile or so of it, my joints/bones/something started complaining though. I found my form slipping, and my left hip got a little sore. Still, nothing serious, and I pushed through. The next day or so my knees and hamstrings were sore, but manageable. 

Sunday was race day in Hyannis. I went in expecting around 1:50, since a race course is presumably harder than a track workout, and I'd be wearing a jacket, but I came in at 1:44:57, so was pleasantly surprised. Watching other racers and the competition definitely gives me a competitive boost to push a little harder. 

The first 8 miles were all a good pace, probably around 7:45 on average. The next three definitely lagged, maybe 8:30-8:40 pace, I couldn't keep it up. But at mile 11, I noticed that if I could keep to 7:30 on the last two I could come in under 1:45:00, so I pushed for it and just barely got there! 

There was a definite improvement on the joint front compared to Wednesday; while I felt them by the end, it was never a limiting factor. The main factor was pure speed and endurance, particularly in those last 2 miles I was huffing and puffing. 

So the total for the week is 2 runs coming in at a marathon of distance! (42km, 26.2 miles) Mileage continues to increase week over week. 

### Diet Review

The week of 2/21 was pretty good, nothing exceptional to report. 

The week of 2/28 was less good. A couple candy runs would be no big deal, but the kicker was a night at a ski house on Thursday. Lots of chips and dip, cookies, etc, and a lot of drinking; maybe 8 or 9 drinks over the course of the day. A couple other not great meals too. The good news is, I ran the time I did despite them, so there's still plenty of room for improvement. 

### The Coming Week

Now that I've got the half down, I'm looking towards the marathon distance in April. I plan to do at least a half marathon distance run every weekend until then. 

Generally, I'll start splitting my training into more speed vs distance work. Up until now, I've just been focusing on steadily adding miles and runs, now it's time to start specializing training sessions. That means once or twice a week will feature long runs, and the others will look more like running club workouts, even if I'm solo. More 400m-mile repeats, working on getting faster at the short distance and then converting that into distance gains. 

Definitely want to get back into the gym this week. Runs will continue to be the focus, but 3-4 gym sessions this week seems like a reasonable goal.
