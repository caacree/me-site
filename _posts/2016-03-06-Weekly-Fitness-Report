### Workout Review

Rested from the race until Wednesday, when running club did a long session: about 8 miles. 

Friday was a 5k run on the treadmill. 

Next, and last, run was Sunday. I had planned to go for about 15 miles, since I want to keep upping my long run distance, but it quickly became apparent that wasn't happening. By a couple miles in, my left leg was killing me; I've had a similar sensation in the past, but never limiting. I dragged myself to 7 miles before returning home.

Some research showed that IT Band Syndrome matches what I've got pretty clearly. So I'll do some stretching and take a couple days off, hopefully be back running by mid-next week. Right now even walking is pretty awkward, I have to keep my left leg locked straight to avoid pain. 

For the numbers, that makes 3 runs of about 18 miles for the week. 

Three gym workouts this week; Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. 

### Diet Review

Not great. Soda and candy a few times, need to stay vigilent! Plus lots of not bad, but also not great sandwich-type meals. Pushing for real healthy stuff would be better. 

### The Coming Week

This week will be dependent on the leg. Current plan is to hopefully try running again by Wednesday, but that's dependent on walking smoothly first. Getting up to 20+ miles somehow is the goal. Try another long run (~15 miles) over the weekend. I bought a foam roller from Amazon and already did some recommended stretches tonight, we'll see how soon results can come. 

Try and stay in the gym no matter the leg situation. Not going to let myself get lazy! Probably could try out the elliptical as well, see if that hurts or not.
