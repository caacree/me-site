It was a disappointing week for fitness. Only three runs and three lifting sessions, and all on the same days. 

### Workout Review

Monday had a gym session in the morning and then running club in the afternoon. I did a hard leg day the previous Sunday, so running performance was just so-so. Started out well, but fell more than I'd like in the second half. 

Tuesday's rest was justified; Monday had been a struggle and my legs needed the break. 

Wednesday I did a morning lifting session followed by a 5k river run. As my first before work running session, it was a success. Didn't do running club, went to a concert instead. 

Next workout wasn't until Saturday, when I did another gym session followed by the 5k river loop. Made some gains on squats though, so that was good. 

Started getting slight pain in the outside of the right ankle/shin while running on Saturday. I've had it before and hoped it was bad shoes, but it seems it's back. I'm thinking it might be a form thing, since it usually doesn't happen and Saturday was a little icy so maybe that threw me off some. Mostly just keeping an eye out if it continues for now, since it's easy to ignore for the moment. 

Sunday was off. 

So in total, just 3 runs for about 15k this week. Not where I want to be.  

### Diet Review

I stuck to the no junk food or soda goal, so that's a positive. Also, I'd say my meals in general ran healthier this week. No fast food, generally healthy choices, etc. Good habits. 

However, drank three days. None were excessive, but the few on Wednesday definitely contributed to taking Thursday off. Will look to limit myself to one day a week for drinking here on out, similar to coffee. 

Weight is at 197. 

### The Coming Week

Need to ramp up my runs. The main priority is at least 5 runs, at least one of which should be 10k. We'll aim for 5 gym workouts as well, but I'm more flexible with those. 

I'm coming into this week fresh, so hopefully won't need a rest day until Thursday. Then possibly one other as needed. 

Diet-wise, nothing crazy. Stick with the current goals; coffee and drinking limited to once a week, generally healthy choices, no soda.
