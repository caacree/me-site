Missed the update last week, the past two weeks have been mostly do hip exercises and overcoming the ITBS stuff. 

### Workout Review Week of 3/13

Rested until Wednesday, did running club then, it was long interval runs, total about 7 miles with warmup. 

Friday I did 30 minutes on the elliptical at full resistance. I'm going to count it was 3 miles for equivalent heart rate/exertion over the same amount of time, though it was actually about a mile. 

I was feeling pretty good by Friday, and wanted to try a long run over the weekend. I got to 9.9 miles on Sunday before the IT Bands took a turn for the worse again. It came on sharp enough this time, right after starting up again at a stoplight. It passed enough for me to walk the rest of the way home after about 5 minutes, but was quite painful for a few moments there, and the suddenness of it made me scared it was a real injury. 

I did get 4 gym sessions in, and started looking into some exercises for the hips specifically, which is apparently what causes ITBS. Some foam rolling and side leg raises were the main things, a little passive stretching. 

Count it at 20 miles for the week. 

### Workout Review Week of 3/20

This week went more or less the same as the previous week as far as running goes. 

Nothing until Wednesday, when I got about another 7 miles in at running club. 

Waited until Saturday for my long run. I'm signed up for a marathon trail run in NY, the Breakneck Trail Marathon, in mid-April, and there was a preview run doing the half marathon course so I drove down there for that. So 13 miles of trail running/hiking, and it was TOUGH. About 4 hours, and that was a solid pace considering the conditions. The full marathon is going to be a challenge to finish, and probably take close to 10 hours. 

So again 20 miles for the week, but total exertion is greater than the equivalent distance on my previous runs. 

Four gym days again, but every day I did 100 clamshells and usually some other hip exercises as well, which I think really helped. The trail run had me sore, but I wasn't limited like before and hopefully I'm starting to strengthen enough to overcome any future IT band issues, especially if I stick with the exercises. 

### Diet Review

Nothing too exceptional, either good or bad. A few drinks, and few candy bars, probably could use a little more focus lately, but nothing too terrible. I've been doing coffee 2-3 times a week lately. 

### The Coming Week

Hoping to get more running days in this week now that the leg finally seems back in good shape. Aiming for my first 30+ mile week, probably 4-5 running days is the goal. I'm signed up for the 22 mile Hopkinton run with Community Running, so the big hope is that I can finish that without the IT stuff flaring up again. Goal time will probably be about 8:00 pace for that, same as I ran the half marathon, but obviously longer distance now.
