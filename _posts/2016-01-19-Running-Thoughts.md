title: Running Thoughts
---
I've taken a somewhat lackadaisical approach to fitness in the past; mostly lifting, but rarely with any consistent diet and training. So progress was notably slower than otherwise. 

That's changing this winter. First off I'll be tracking my diet more closely to make sure I hit my total calorie goals, and I'll keep an eye on my macros. 

Also I'll be making my primary fitness goals revolve around running. My goal is to be accepted to the 2017 Barkley Marathon. For those who don't know, the Barkley is a 60-hour, 100 mile race through the Tennessee mountains that has the equivalent elevation change of climbing and descending Mt. Everest twice. There's a great video on it [here](https://vimeo.com/97270099). 

That gives me roughly 14 months to get in world-class endurance running shape. A high mark, to be sure. I'll be documenting the training here in weekly updates. 

My background; I started running about 8 months ago intermittently, but took a two month break recently while job searching and moving. My longest runs so far have been 10k's, with my fastest around 46 minutes. All were just on a track, no official races. 

So here's a rough goal breakdown:
* Early February - Be back in top running shape (45-50 min 10k)
* April - Run my first Marathon
* May - Start trail running
* Run several Marathons throughout the summer
* September - Run ultramarathon
* October - Test a couple long mountain runs
* Work on pace and distance throughout the winter
* March 2017 - The Barkley

It's an ambitious pace and will likely see adjustments as things progress, but those are the goals. I'm hampered by the weather here in Boston. Most of my running will be on treadmills during the winter, though I'll do at least one long run outside each weekend, and hopefully more. I'll post what I learn about winter running clothes and adjustments here as well, but I don't think I'll be doing nightly outdoor runs. 

I'll be starting off running 4 times a week, but ramp that up as quickly as I feel I can without injury, both in miles and frequency. Weekly Sunday night updates will post the past week's runs and goals for the coming week. On that note, for the coming week:
* Wednesday - 5k at <30:00
* Friday - 5k at <28:30
* Saturday - 400m Track Sprints
* Sunday - 10k slow

Also, I'll be continuing weightlifting during this time, but if there's a time conflict I'm favoring running. Leg days will be scheduled primarily for rest days, or on endurance days. Generally speaking I lift in the mornings and run in the afternoons.
