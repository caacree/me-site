The first week on the path was not what it could have been, but still a start. 

### Workout Review

Wednesday did not get a run in; I didn't realize until 10 minutes after I left the house that my socks had a hole in the back, and my heel was rubbed to about bleeding by the time I got to work. I still lifted, but running seemed out of the question. 

Thursday was a big one. Leg day in the morning and then did a 5k treadmill run in the evening, 26:40. Not a bad time, but part of that is the treadmill boost. 

Friday was rough. Jumping back into working out gives some serious DOMS. I was walking funny and taking it easy on stairs for all of Friday and Saturday. No workouts at all Friday. 

But I wasn't gonna let myself skip two days in a row, damn the soreness. So did a pull day on weights followed by another 5k treadmill run, this time at a miserable 29:50 pace, just barely pushed myself to beat 30 min. 

Sunday was another rest day. I could have done another workout, but wanted to make sure I was fully recovered for tomorrow, since I'll be checking out a running club. 

In all, this means I did just 2 runs instead of 4 this week, which is bad. But I hadn't taken into account the soreness when jumping back in. Fortunately, I'll be over it within another two or three leg days and ready to be a workout machine! 

### Diet Review

I had a few drinks on Wednesday, as there was both a small party for finishing training at my new job, as well as a company hosted evening event. Also had one drink at a Salsa dance on Saturday. Hope to get better at shunning it as time goes on. 

General diet was just so-so. Had a large calzone on Saturday, and my lunches are generally whatever is served near work; usually not bad, but not great. Sandwiches, barbeque plates, etc. I plan to cook more this week to stay healthy. 

Also, I ordered some protein and stocked up on some healthy food for around the house, so it'll hopefully be easier to avoid temptation, at least at home. 

### Other Notes

I'm coming into this the heaviest I've ever been. My weight has traditionally fluctuated around 175-185, but right now I'm 194. I couldn't believe it, but a second scale confirmed. This is the heaviest I've been, especially surprising considering I think I was ~180 in mid-October before my return to America and slothiness, and that was a relatively lean 180, since I'd been on a heavy workout schedule. So the past few months have been quite damaging, but that's my starting point. 

I'm actually planning on bulking a bit more through the winter, though we'll see how it plays out since I apparently already am a little heavier than is purely functional. The focus now will be on eating healthy, without stressing the calories too much. To the extent that I do track them though, I'll be looking to bulk, not slim. It's a good time to build muscle and I can look at slimming in March or April as I start to up my distances. 

Bought a new pair of shoes. The ones I've been using have been starting to give me some pain after about 3-4k in my right foot, on the front of the shin. I'd noticed before, but it's worse now. So I went over to Boston Marathon and picked up a new pair of Mizuno Wave Runner 18's, which will hopefully solve that problem. In the past I've had shoes that never bothered me, so I don't think it's a fundamental form or gait problem. 

Speaking of form and gait, I'll be checking out a running club or two this week. Partially as a motivational tool, but also as a way to get feedback from experienced runners and coaches on things. While I think running is generally pretty straightforward, I have no training background and am sure there's lots of valuable advice on how to improve and avoid injury I could benefit from. The plan is to check out Community Running on Monday. 

Lastly, two workouts on the treadmill have already given me some doubt. I could continue, and I'm sure necessity will dictate I use it sometimes, but it's not comfortable and I don't really trust the numbers I'm getting from it or how it affects my form. So I'll be braving the cold and trying to keep outdoor running. I picked up some basic cold-weather gear to test things out. 

### The Coming Week

Lift every day. Tentative running schedule below, might vary based on soreness from runs and leg days. 

* Monday - Community Running Club Workout
* Tuesday - Try an outdoor morning run near work, mostly about exploration
* Wednesday - Community Running Club (tentative)
* Thursday - Rest
* Friday - 5k
* Saturday - 10k
* Sunday - Rest

Diet-wise, goal is no alcohol and no coffee. I realize coffee is somewhat divided on the health topic, I just don't want to get accustomed to it like mayn do around here, and since my work has a barista it would be easy to get addicted. I'll be doing morning workouts anyways so shouldn't need it. Other than that, healthier is better, but those are the big two goals.
