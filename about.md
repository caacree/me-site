Hey! I'm a software developer with a focus on data analysis and backend systems. 

I graduated in 2012 with a degree in Economics and Math, so am mostly a self-taught programmer. I worked as a data analyst at PayScale followed by a 2-year scholarship stint in Xiamen, China. Since then, I've worked on several data analysis and web development projects. 

Still do most of my work in Python and Javascript, but I'm always interested in trying new things. Check out some of my [projects](http://christopheracree.com/projects).
