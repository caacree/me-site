Hey! I'm a web and software developer with a focus on backend systems. I'll use this site to occasionally blog about my programming challenges and goals. 

I started teaching myself Python in 2012 while working as a data analyst, and since then have worked on several data analysis and web development projects. Still do most of my work in Python and Javascript, but I'm always interested in trying new things. 
I freelance! If you're looking for a full-stack developer, or even just front or back-end, let's talk.
