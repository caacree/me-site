This page only contains projects I have independently undertaken; coding, devOps, design, etc. 


[Akrito](https://www.akrito.com/) is an online publishing site where anyone can write a story one chapter at a time. It features flexible pricing models like "pay only for the latest chapter" in addition to allowing normal paid and free stories. Automatic ebook generation, email updates to story followers, and a "quick start" interface make writing and reading easy. This was originally built as a prospective for general licensing of fanfiction, but no major brands have taken the leap. 

[South China Sea](http://southchinasea.co) is a site giving a basic overview of the territorial dispute in the South China Sea. It features an interactive map with information about each disputant and a guide to the islands, as well as a primer to the legal issues and current situation.
